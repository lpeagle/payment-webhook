Simple payment webhook service

This simple code is far from real business applications, such as in the following aspect:

    • Real reconciliation logic will be very complicated based on many factors: amount, currency, datetime, etc. I just use the very simple field(id/amount) for the simplest test.

    • The splitid logic is not implemented as the logic is not very clear. 

    • Not differentiating transaction types as well. Assuming all is Auth. 

    • The fileds beging processed is minimal for demo purpose.
